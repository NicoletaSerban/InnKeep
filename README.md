# Inn Keep

Inn Keep is a maintenance management app for hotels, inns, and other similar establishments. The app allows staff members to create tasks to inform the manager of any problems that need to be addressed, such as broken appliances or damaged fixtures. The manager can then assign an active member of the staff to resolve the problem. Inn Keep helps to streamline the maintenance process, making it easier for managers to keep track of issues and ensure that they are resolved in a timely manner.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, Express, Tailwindcss,

Inn Keep is a web-based maintenance management app that is built using a combination of modern web technologies. The front-end of the app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which provide the layout, styling, and interactive features of the app. On the back-end, the app utilizes Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment andt Express, to handle server-side logic, such as connecting to the database and handling routes.
Overall, the combination of these technologies provides a flexible and powerful stack for building web applications, and allows for a smooth development process and providing a flexible and robust solution for maintaining hotels and inns.

## Optimizations

Adding new features such as the ability to delete and update tasks, as well as the ability to sort tasks by importance, would further enhance the functionality and usability of Inn Keep.

The ability to delete and update tasks would give managers more control over their maintenance tasks, allowing them to easily manage their tasks and keep track of progress. This can be achieved by adding new routes and functionality to the back-end and front-end of the app.

The ability to sort tasks by importance would help managers prioritize their tasks and ensure that the most important tasks are addressed first. This could be done by adding a new sorting algorithm to the back-end of the app, and updating the front-end to display tasks in the desired order.

Overall, these new features would provide managers with more flexibility and control over their maintenance tasks, making it easier for them to manage their tasks and keep track of progress.

## Lessons Learned:

As a developer of Inn Keep, one of the key lessons that I have learned is the importance of gathering user feedback and incorporating it into the app. By doing this, I was able to ensure that the app continues to meet the needs of its users and improve overall satisfaction and adoption. Additionally, I learned the value of a well-designed user interface. I saw firsthand how a well-designed UI makes it easy for users to navigate and use the app, which can improve overall satisfaction and adoption. Another important lesson I learned was the benefits of using a flexible and scalable architecture. By using a microservices architecture, I was able to easily extend and adapt the app to meet the changing needs of its users. Furthermore, testing and implementing continuous integration and deployment practices helped me catch bugs early, ensure that new features can be deployed quickly and safely and make sure it runs smoothly. Lastly, working in a group taught me the importance of clear communication and delegation of tasks, it was a great experience and help me to learn how to work better as a team.
